              I love to code, travel, cook, and learn about new things in my spare time. I especially enjoy attending hackathons as I get to challenge myself and learn new skills.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Whether its machine learning or web programming, Iâ€™m always willing to learn new skills and experiment with them. Feel free to reach out to me anytime.
